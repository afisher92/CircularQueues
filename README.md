# CircularQueues

Hi folks. Before you make any changes be sure to review the github tutorial so you know how this sucker works. It is going to be very useful in that I won't always have to be the hub of information from now on. Also review: project spec, then be sure to create a new branch so you don't accidentially destroy the master files. Then, when making changes, ALWAYS comment your code so it's easier to commit to the final version.
